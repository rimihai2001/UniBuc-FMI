## App Description

Web Application written with Angular and Bootstrap that shows what type of music is played in different locations(Clubs/Restauratns/Cafes etc.) and the usual volume.

Although maybe not evident at first , the volume and type of music played somewhere plays a huge role in how much we enjoy ourselves when going out.Sometimes it is not even a difference in taste , maybe it is just a different vibe than we were going for. Or maybe the music is simply too loud for working. Or too quiet for partying.

This is where we come in :)

Our app offers all the necessary stats and info in order to make the best possible decision. For each place , the volume is rated from 0 to 10 , 10 being the loudest possible level of music. The genres played there are listed clearly , in order for anybody to find the most suitable place from the list.
